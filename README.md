## Development

Clone the repo and run `yarn install` to install all of the dependencies. 

Run `yarn run dev` to enter development mode. This will launch a server for you to actively develop with hot module reloading and live reloading of styles.

## Deployment

Please make PR's to add anything. PR's will be merged to `master` and then to `production`. Merging to the `production` branch will automatically deploy the changes to the `gh-pages` branch via circleci.


## Next.js
