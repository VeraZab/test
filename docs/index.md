# Plotly marketing pages

This is the repo that houses all of the pages that are outside of the main plot.ly application. It's built in react, using next.js. 

The site is set up with CircleCI to allow for testing and easy, automated deployments.

Much of the content of the site is pulled from prismic.io.

The content is composed of documents (pages) and then slices (content sections).
