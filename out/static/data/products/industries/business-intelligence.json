The team had to download data from our Ad Serving Platform, import it into Excel, and run custom VBA macros to generate each individual Excel report, which would then be emailed to the client every few days. When we found Plot.ly, we were able to completely revamp our reporting process. Using Python, Plotly and Pandas, we created a brand new reporting portal where clients could view up-to-date campaign performance data in beautifully designed, custom dashboards. We were finally able to provide the real-time visibility our clients were asking for without wasting our team's precious time manually generating hundreds of Excel reports each week. "
