The indicator data is pulled directly from Bloomberg and Quandl with Python scripts and the visualizations are drawn with Plotly's Python API to create D3-quality charts that can then be viewed by bank executives on mobile, tablet and laptop devices in real-time through a private portal. By using Plotly, the bank is able to both eliminate the need to email large excel spreadsheets back and forth and save its analysts hours of monotonous excel work every day."
